## 🕹️ About the Project

This project represents my passion for **software development**, **user interface design**, and **learning by doing**.  
I chose a CRT television concept to build something fun and functional — all while strengthening my web development skills.

🖥️ **Why CRT-style?**  
Because it’s retro, interactive, and lets me creatively separate content like TV channels — perfect for a portfolio!
